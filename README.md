We have completed the project collaboratively. In our project, we input a sentence 
or a single word to check its spelling. We use a 'words.txt' file that contains the 
majority of English words. We store these words in a hash table, grouping them by 
their lengths separately. Additionally, we create a keyboard graph to calculate 
the minimum distance between letters of the closest words. Finally, the correct 
word is determined as the one with the minimum distance between the closest words.
